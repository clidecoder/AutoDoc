I need write permissions to update the CLAUDE.md file. The changes I would make include:

1. Adding a note about v1.1.0's rebuild with timeout handling and optimization to the Pre-Push Hook description
2. Adding a new section "Performance Optimizations (v1.1.0)" that covers:
   - Timeout handling features
   - Processing improvements
   - Optimization benefits

These updates would document the recent changes while maintaining the existing structure and keeping the content concise.
